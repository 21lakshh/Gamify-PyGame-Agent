## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyGame library
- Streamlit
- Google Gemini API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Gamify
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your API key:
   - Get a Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Enter the API key in the application's sidebar

### Running the Application

1. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run pygamebuilder.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

## üéÆ How to Use

### 1. Generating Code
- Enter your PyGame visualization query in the text area
- Example: "Create a particle system simulation where 100 particles emit from the mouse position and respond to keyboard-controlled wind forces"
- Click "Generate Code" to create the PyGame implementation

### 2. Editing and Testing
- Review the generated code in the expandable code section
- Edit the code directly in the text area if needed
- Use the "Test Run" button to check for errors
- Fix any issues based on the debug information

### 3. Running the Game
- Click "Run Visualization" to start the game
- A new window will open with your PyGame visualization
- Use the controls as described in the game instructions
- Close the window when done playing

### 4. Controls
- **Mouse**: Control particle emission
- **Arrow Keys**: Control wind direction
- **Space**: Pause/Resume simulation
- **R**: Reset simulation
- **ESC**: Quit game

   - Handles code extraction and formatting
   - Provides fallback mechanisms for error cases

2. **Game Execution**
   - Manages PyGame initialization and cleanup
   - Handles window creation and event loops
   - Provides error handling and debugging

3. **User Interface**
   - Streamlit-based web interface
   - Real-time code editing and testing
   - Persistent state management

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your Gemini API key is valid
   - Check the key in the sidebar configuration

2. **PyGame Errors**
   - Verify PyGame installation
   - Check for missing dependencies
   - Review error messages in the debug section

3. **Window Not Opening**
   - Ensure no other PyGame windows are running
   - Check system graphics drivers
   - Verify Python environment setup

### Getting Help
- Check the debug information in the application
- Review error messages and tracebacks
- Use the test run feature to identify issues
